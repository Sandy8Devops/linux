3 types of accounts

root user has every access also called super user
regular user :  user create to use specific need
service user : used internally by linux to do system works ie: mysql user created default to manage mysql db

have their own space and directory structures

Don't Do :  run services with root user, create specific user and asssign permission to that service user

GROUPS and PERMISSION
----
permission could be given to 
a. user 
b. group
c. other group

Files
----
/etc/passwd  #stores user info, only root can udpate but other can use it
Format:
username:password:uid:gid:gecos:homedir:shell
x in password = encrypted password save in  /etc/shadow
gid stored in /etc/group file
shell: user default shell to use after login

/etc/shadow
/etc/group

Note:  don't edit the files directly , use commands 
eg: 
add user :  $adduser tom 
provide password and confirm password
add user with in a group $useradd -G devops tom

change password :  $sudo passwd tom
provide password for tom and done

switch user
$ su - tom
$ su -  //switch to root user

Creating Group:
$groupadd devops

Add user to Group
$usermod -g devops tom  //add tom to group devops

when user is created a default group is created with it ie: for user tom group tom is also created

Delete group
$delgroup tom

A user can be added to multiple groups
$usermod -G admin,devops tom //overides the group for user tom, existing group

Remove user from  a Group
$gpasswd -d tom devops  //removes tom user from devops
