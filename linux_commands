LINUX
----
After login the prompt will look like 
sandy@server1:~$
above sandy is user, afer @ server1 is machine , after : is current user (sandy) home directory 
normal user has : $ sign
if logged with root : # sign will be ther


SYSTEM
$uname -a //os,version, kernel info
$ cat /etc/os-release  //to find the os release files
$ lscpu //to find the cpu
$lsmem. //total ram used

Go to Root Directory
$ cd /
$clear //to clear the screen
$pwd // to see current working directory

PACKAGE MANAGER
-------
windows we have exe/msi 
on linux we use package manager to install software package
package are zipped/archieved libraries, which may be depdendets on other libraries
Ubuntu : apt (advanced pacakge tool) package manager 
eg: apt get install node
Search :  $ apt search openjdk //see all option to install
$ java //will show all apt options and java to install
select one of the option and setup
Remove: $ apt remove openjdk
apt get vs apt = apt is more user friendly, but same for usability
All the pacakges of softwares are pulled from a Repository
ubuntu, Rhel, Centos have their own Repository
$sudo apt update //will show what pacakges could be updated and from where they are located
location of repository :  /etc/apt/sources.list file

Snap 
is another pacakge manager in ubutnu 
eg: to setup ubunut
$ snap install --classic code // will install vscode in ubuntu

if some pacakges are not in existing repository list of url 
need to add them in the list to pull from 
$ sudo add-apt-repository "url..."

Similary for Redhat based Linux , use yum package manager
RHEL, CentOs, Fedora = RHEL based
Ubunut, Debian, Mint = Debian Based
